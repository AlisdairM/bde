Basic Build Instructions (Open Source)
======================================

BDE uses a build system based on [cmake](https://cmake.org), which is located
in the BDE Tools repository.

The following commands can be used to configure and build the BDE repository:
1. Clone the `bde-tools` and `bde` repositories and add `bde-tools` to your `PATH`:
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools.git
   $ export PATH=$PWD/bde-tools/bin:$PATH      # add bde-tools to the 'PATH'
   $ git clone https://github.com/bloomberg/bde.git
   $ cd bde
   ```

2. From the root of this source repository, run:

   ```shell
   $ export BDE_CMAKE_BUILD_DIR=$PWD/_build   # configure the build directory
   $ cmake_build.py configure -u dbg_exc_mt_64_cpp14
   ```

3. To build the libraries, but not the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   $ cmake_build.py build
   ```

   To also build the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   $ cmake_build.py build --test build
   ```

   To build and run the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   $ cmake_build.py build --test run
   ```
