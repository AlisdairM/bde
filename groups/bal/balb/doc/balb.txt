@DESCRIPTION: The 'balb' package provides support for an assortment of common

 'balb' includes the following:

: o A mechanism for monitoring and reporting the observable performance of a
:   process.
:
: o Classes for (1) defining commands (as short strings), (2) passing these
:   commands through a pipe-channel to a running process, and (3) registering
:   callback functions to be invoked upon reception of such commands.
:
: o A multi-process performance reporting mechanism and a value-semantic type
:   to represent metrics.  Note that the entire {'balm'} package is dedicated
:   to metrics gathering.
