@PURPOSE: Provide metrics registrars.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Development Library Metrics (bdlm)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdlm' package provides a means for low-level library
 software to collect and publish metrics through a metric publishing framework,
 without a library depending on the metrics publishing framework.  The 'bdlm'
 package provides a protocol (i.e., a pure abstract interface),
 'bdlm::MetricsAdapter', that can be implemented for (higher level) metrics
 facilities.  In addition, it also provides a registry of metrics,
 'bdlm::MetricRegistry', that allows low-level users of 'bdlm' to register
 metrics at any time, serving as an intermediary with concrete
 'bdlm::MetricsAdapter' implementations (which may be configured before or
 after the creation of any particular metric).

 As a low-level metrics facility, this package does not directly manage
 schedulers to collect metrics values or publishers to publish collected
 values.  Instead it is designed to allow applications to plug in different
 high-level feature-rich metrics collection and publication frameworks (without
 requiring a library dependency on those frameworks).

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bdlm' package currently has 5 components having 4 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
