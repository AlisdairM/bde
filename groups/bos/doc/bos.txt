@PURPOSE: Provide intercept headers substituting bsl:: symbols for standard
          std:: symbols.

@MNEMONIC: BSL_OVERRIDES_STD library (bos)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bos' ("BSL_OVERRIDES_STD Library") package group contains
 one package that provides intercept headers for the C++ standard library
 headers, rendering 'std' as merely an alias to 'bsl' (i.e., 'std::vector' will
 be the same as 'bsl::vector').  This is also known as the 'BDE-STL' mode.  For
 more information, please see the package level documentation in 'bos+stdhdrs'.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bos' package group currently has 2 packages having 1 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the packages.
 The order of packages within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
..
  1. bos+stdhdrs                                         !DEPRECATED!
     bosscm
..
 Note that the 'bos+stdhdrs' package is only a compatibility layer for
 Bloomberg managed code.  It is not an essential package for the rest of the
 BDE libraries (i.e., all other package groups above 'bsl' will compile and
 function without 'bos+stdhdrs').  This package implements the logic required
 for 'BDE-STL' mode.

/Package Synopsis

: 'bos+stdhdrs':                                         !DEPRECATED!
:      Provide a compatibility layer to enable BDE-STL mode in Bloomberg.
:
: 'bosscm':
:      Provide versioning information for library components in 'bos'.

/Package Overview
/----------------
 This section provides a brief introduction to the package of the 'bos'
 package group.

/'bos+stdhdrs'
/- - - - - - -
 The {'bos+stdhdrs'} package provides a compatibility layer to for the
 'BDE-STL' mode.  When users include standard C++ headers from this directory
 (e.g., 'vector', 'algorithm'), and use standard STL types such as
 'std::vector', 'std::cout', users will be using the corresponding 'bsl'
 version instead (i.e., 'std::vector' is the same as 'bsl::vector').
