@PURPOSE: Empty scaffolding for a package group which will eventually provide
          intercept headers substituting bsl:: symbols for standard std::
          symbols.

@MNEMONIC: BSL_OVERRIDES_STD library (bos)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bos' ("BSL_OVERRIDES_STD Library") package group will
 contain one package that will provide intercept headers for the C++ standard
 library headers, rendering 'std' as merely an alias to 'bsl' (i.e.,
 'std::vector' will be the same as 'bsl::vector').  This is also known as the
 'BDE-STL' mode.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bos' package group currently has 1 package.

/Package Synopsis

: 'bosscm':
:      Provide versioning information for library components in 'bos'.

/Package Overview
/----------------
 This section provides a brief introduction to the package of the 'bos'
 package group.

/'bosscm'
/ - - - -
 The {'bslscm'} package contains only two components, 'bosscm_version' and
 'bosscm_versiontag'.  The first of these components is included by every other
 component in 'bos', and provides versioning information for the package group.
 Users may use the 'bosscm_version' facilities to query a particular 'bos'
 library for its version information.  The second component defines macros that
 can be used for conditional-compilation based on 'bos' version information.
