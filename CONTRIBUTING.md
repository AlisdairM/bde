# Contributing to BSL #

If you'd like to help us improve and extend BSL (and eventually other BDE libraries) and become a part of the BDE community,
then we welcome your contributions! 

Please review our [Contributing to
BSL](http://github.com/bloomberg/bsl/wiki/Contributing-to-BSL) page
for the basic steps required to be able to contribute to BSL/BDE. If
you have any questions about this process or any other aspect of
contributing to a Bloomberg open source project, feel free to send an
email to [open-tech@bloomberg.net](mailto:open-tech@bloomberg.net) and
we'll get your questions answered as quickly as we can.
