What's New
==========

October 2014:
Important new features include:
  * [bslh](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde/blob/master/groups/bsl/bslh/doc/bslh.txt) - An implementation of [C++ ISO Proposal N3980](http://isocpp.org/files/papers/n3980.html), which significantly improves how hash functions are defined
  * `bdlt` - A collection of date and time types, and utilities for manipulating them.  Of particular note:
      * `bdlt::Date`
      * `bdlt::Datetime`
      * `bdlt::CurrentTime`
  * [bdldfp::Decimal](http://bloomberg.github.io/bde/group__bdldfp__decimal.html) types are now 10X faster, making use of the [Intel Decimal Floating Point Math Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-decimal-floating-point-math-library)
  * Support for Visual Studio 2013

  See BDE 2.22 Relase Notes.

  Note that `bdlt` is available on `master` but is not on `releases/2.22.x`.

Basic Build Instructions
========================

BDE uses a build system based on [waf](http://code.google.com/p/waf), which is
located in the [BDE Tools](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/)
repository. This build system must be set up before being used:

1. Make sure that python 2.6 - 2.7 are installed on the system.
2. Download [BDE Tools](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/) and add the
   path `<bde_tools_repo_root>/bin` to the system `PATH` environment
   variable. Make sure the first `waf` command found in `PATH` is a script from that path.

Once the waf based build system has been set up. The following commands can be
used to configure and build the BDE repository:

1. From the root of this source repository, run:

   ```shell
   waf configure
   ```

2. To build the libraries, but not the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   waf build
   ```

   To also build the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   waf build --test build
   ```

   To build and run the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   waf build --test run
   ```

For more details on building the BDE repository, please see the
[Quick Start Guide](http://github.com/bloomberg/bde/wiki/Getting-Started).

repositories, please see
